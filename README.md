HELLO WORLD,IT'S NURGIZA!

I want to win MacBook,but you know,it's not easy,my third day is already hard,I watched all the videos to just text here "hello world"

Hope,I'll be the expert in github!


 - 👀 I’m interested in coding
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work on github
 - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my future projects,but now I need to learn everything by myself 
 -  📫 How to reach me if you'd like to teach me -> instagram @iza194.84

##### -  day 7: i have downloaded java and intellij,now just watching videos from youtube,tutorials,it is so hard to learn sth by yourself,without any teacher,but i wont give up,i wanna buy courses,hahah. one thing i know properly is now to make a text here bold and how to minimize its size,also how to commit your work

##### - day 17: today I don't have a computer with myself, so I can't practice on coding by YouTube tutorials,that's why I'm writing my "arman" here,when I'll get my own laptop ig I'll go to courses, cuz it's so hard for me to code because of that I always have denials command on terminal, and I always kill my time correcting the error.
